Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Concepts Guide

This repository covers DSA concepts from beginner to advanced, with a focus on problem-solving, interviews, and real-world usage.

🔹 1. Time & Space Complexity
What is Time Complexity?

Time complexity measures how the execution time grows with input size.

Common Notations:

O(1) – Constant time
 
O(log n) – Logarithmic

O(n) – Linear

O(n log n) – Efficient sorting

O(n²) – Nested loops

What is Space Complexity?

Space complexity measures extra memory used by an algorithm.

🔹 2. Arrays
What is an Array?

A contiguous memory structure that stores elements of the same type.

Key Operations:

Access → O(1)

Insertion / Deletion → O(n)

Traversal → O(n)

Use cases: Lists, buffers, sliding window problems.

🔹 3. Strings
What is a String?

A sequence of characters.

Common Operations:

Reversal

Palindrome check

Anagram check

Frequency count

Important: Strings are immutable in many languages.

🔹 4. Recursion
What is Recursion?

A function that calls itself until a base condition is met.

Key Parts:

Base Case

Recursive Case

Examples: Factorial, Fibonacci, Tree traversal.

🔹 5. Searching Algorithms
Linear Search

Checks each element

Time: O(n)

Binary Search

Works on sorted arrays

Time: O(log n)

🔹 6. Sorting Algorithms
Basic Sorts

Bubble Sort → O(n²)

Selection Sort → O(n²)

Insertion Sort → O(n²)

Efficient Sorts

Merge Sort → O(n log n)

Quick Sort → O(n log n) average

🔹 7. Linked List
What is a Linked List?

A collection of nodes where each node points to the next.

Types:

Singly Linked List

Doubly Linked List

Pros: Dynamic size
Cons: No random access

🔹 8. Stack
What is a Stack?

A LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure.

Operations:

push

pop

peek

Use cases: Undo/Redo, recursion, expression evaluation.

🔹 9. Queue
What is a Queue?

A FIFO (First In First Out) data structure.

Types:

Simple Queue

Circular Queue

Deque

Use cases: Scheduling, BFS.

🔹 10. Hashing
What is Hashing?

Maps keys to values using a hash function.

Time Complexity:

Average: O(1)

Worst: O(n)

Use cases: Frequency count, caching.

🔹 11. Trees
Binary Tree

Each node has at most two children.

Binary Search Tree (BST)

Left < Root < Right

Search time: O(log n) average

Tree Traversals

Inorder

Preorder

Postorder

Level Order

🔹 12. Heaps
What is a Heap?

A complete binary tree.

Types:

Min Heap

Max Heap

Use cases: Priority Queue, scheduling.

🔹 13. Graphs
What is a Graph?

A set of nodes (vertices) and edges.

Representations:

Adjacency List

Adjacency Matrix

Traversals

BFS (Queue)

DFS (Stack / Recursion)

🔹 14. Dynamic Programming (DP)
What is DP?

An optimization technique to avoid recomputation.

Techniques:

Memoization (Top-down)

Tabulation (Bottom-up)

Examples: Knapsack, Fibonacci, LCS.

🔹 15. Greedy Algorithms
What is Greedy?

Chooses the best option at each step.

Examples: Activity selection, coin change (greedy version).

🔹 16. Backtracking
What is Backtracking?

Explores all possibilities and backs out of invalid ones.

Examples: N-Queens, Sudoku solver.

🔹 17. Bit Manipulation
What is Bit Manipulation?

Solving problems using bitwise operators.

Operators:

AND (&)

OR (|)

XOR (^)

Left Shift (<<)

Right Shift (>>)

Use cases: Optimizations, missing number, power of two.

🔹 18. Common Problem-Solving Patterns

Two Pointers

Sliding Window

Prefix Sum

Divide & Conquer

Fast & Slow Pointers

📌 Interview Tips

Always explain brute force → optimized

Analyze time & space

Write clean code

Think in patterns, not memorization

✅ Goal of This Repository

To build strong DSA fundamentals for interviews, problem-solving, and real-world development.
